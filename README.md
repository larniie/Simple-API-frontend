# Simple API + Frontend App

## Overview
This project demonstrates how a frontend application communicates with a backend API using HTTP requests and JSON responses.

The goal was to understand how real-world web and cloud-based applications connect user interfaces to backend services.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- REST API
- JSON
- Fetch API

## Features
- User input form
- Backend API endpoint
- Frontend-to-backend communication
- Real-time result display

## How It Works
1. The user enters two numbers and selects an operation.
2. The frontend sends the data to the Flask API using a POST request.
3. The backend processes the request and returns a JSON response.
4. The frontend displays the result dynamically.

## Why This Project Matters
This project helped me understand:
- How APIs connect frontends and backends
- How data flows in cloud-based systems
- Core concepts expected of junior developers

## Future Improvements
- Deploy backend to a cloud platform
- Add authentication
- Convert frontend to React
